**Note:** This is a BETA VERSION of a new plugin that will be free and open source, so there will be bugs and stability issues. Some features may not work as expected on all browsers. 

I welcome bugfixes and questions, but cannot guarantee quick response time until the official version is released. 

THANK YOU!!

## What is a **Card Sort** study?

A card sort (or pile sort) is a research method that anthropologists use to study how people categorize ideas. The researcher asks the interviewee to sort cards with words or pictures on them into piles, and then asks them to name and describe the piles. A Card Sort Study includes two types of sorting: **_constrained_** and **_unconstrained_***.* The default is "Unconstrained" where the participants create and name their own piles. In a constrained study, researchers name the piles and add rules like “participants must put at least 1 card in each pile”. For more information on card sort studies, and the original vision for this plugin see the Anthrohack [google slideshow here. ](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vQOX5eaHgjusUovmNez_gaySEWhf__anKzTjqp4wFORGxMyC0nY0yEFnH1Qhi04X7-28DsqSV7hQa8k/embed?start=false&loop=false&delayms=60000000)

## The Card Sort **Wordpress** plugin

This project uses Wordpress ( as of this writing, the single most used CMS in the world ) to allow researchers to create card sort studies easily and to conduct their research anywhere there is an internet connection. Usage should be easy: simply create a new Wordpress website at [https://wordpress.com/](https://wordpress.com/) or download and install the self-hosted version at [https://wordpress.org/](https://wordpress.org/), install the Card Sort plugin, set up your study and send the link out to your research participants. 

## Installation

1. Download this repository as a zip file by clicking on the "Clone or Download" button.

2. Go to the plugins section of your wordpress dashboard and click "Add New", then “Upload plugin”.

3. Once uploaded, click "Activate"

## Usage

1. Once the plugin is activated, a new link for "Studies" will appear in the Admin menu. Click “Add New” to make a new study.

2. A screen to edit the new study will appear. Add a name and the "Research protocol", which is a Description of the study which will be visible to the participants.

3. Click the checkbox for "Constrained" if you would like to create and name piles for the participants to use. The default is “Unconstrained” where the participants create and name their own piles. 

4. Enter preferences about the study incuding

5. a "Thank you" page to redirect to once the participant is finished, 

6. Add Survey Questions by clicking on the button for "Add Questions" These are questions to ask the participant once they are done sorting the cards. 

7. Finally, add cards by clicking on the "Add Card" button. These are the cards the participants will sort into piles. You can add a background color and/or picture to the cards but most researchers will leave them blank (except in the case where the content of the cards **_are_** images).

8. You can set default options for all cards in the study using the "Card Styling" panel at the very bottom. Options set on individual cars will override these default settings. 

9. Once all the settings, cards and survey questions are set, publish your study! You can view it by clicking "View Study" in the admin bar.

10. You can also embed your study in another page by copying the shortcode (shown near the top of the "study options" box) and pasting it into the content of any page.

## Viewing Study Results

1. Go to "Study Submissions" in the Wordpress Admin menu. You will see a list of submissions (all of the studies are visible by default). Each entry is named for the study and when it was submitted (ie: Test Study - sort 2 would be the second submission of “Test Study”) 

![image alt text]({{ site.url }}/public/BzC7fC6PnqJDi1LkGd2GyQ_img_4.png)

2. You can filter the list by selecting a study to view submissions from in the drop-down menu.

3. ONce filtered, click "Select All" and export as a CSV for further analysis.
